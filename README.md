# Purpose of the Assignment

This assignment was meant to develop competence to create Jupyter notebooks using both Python and R. It showed the similarities and differences in how to import the dataset and create a simple visualization. It is also meant to develop competence to share materials to Git. This is my next step, and I am a bit nervous. However, I have already added some materials to my Repo. 

# Tools and Libraries

For this assignment Python and R were the primary tools. Python used the Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciKit -learn packages. These were installed via PIP. For R, the ggplot2 package was used. I also installed the xlsx package. 

# Results

The regression model accounted for ~76% for the model's varianced after adjusting for the number of variables used in the R output and ~79% in the python unadjusted output. 

# Part 2 Error

I kept getting this error for part 2:
